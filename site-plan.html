      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Josh and my idea is to make a website for a new business. I want to start an online art gallery. I hope to help more artists in the world have more of an opportunity to show off their masterpieces. On this website you will be able to submit art work which will then be displayed for others to look at. The people who visit this site will be able to like the art that they want and I hope to adapt the website to show them more of what they like sorted out from everything else. I want to bring more connection into the world and I think this is a great place to start.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who likes art, focusing in on teenagers and young adults who like to draw.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <p> Welcome! Here on Art U Like you can see all kinds of different artwork from the 4 corners of the internet. You can filter the art you see, as well as like the pictures/ drawings/ images and your preferences will be saved. You will then get more of a personalized experience here on the site.
        The different styles this website will be focusing on are, Digital/ Modern art, Religious pieces, Abstract, and Fantasy. Now, you are more than welcome to add artwork from a different style or category but those 4 are what we will be starting with as I build the website.
